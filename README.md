# Stock Trend Analyser
### <i>Simple Stock Trend Analyser using Sequential Model and LSTM (Long short-term memory) - Recurrent Neural Network deep learning.</i>
<!-- 
- The data is extracted using the 'pandas_datareader' library which inturn takes readings from the Yahoo Stocks page.
- Only 2 columns / data componenets are relevant to us: Stock TIcker(Name of the Stock) and 
- We dvide the exisitng extracted data into training data and testing data. In this case we take Training Data to be 70% of the total numbe rof records. And testing data remains 30%.
- We then plot the daily close value, along with different graphs containing 100 day moving average and 200 day moving average collectively.
- Then we import sequential model imported from the 'keras' library and save the model with a  _.h5_ extension.
- Then we apply our model on to our training data.    -->
